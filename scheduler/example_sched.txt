#Example Scheduler file with inputs for the scheduler. The parameters are comma separated for clarity.
#Any spaces in the parameters themselves will be removed. 
#
#The list of parameters is obviously dependent on the type of job that is required
#
#Types can be:
#      Cal: Calibration frame(s). Can be, in the future, lots of stuff, like 'Bias', 'Flat', 'Dark', 'Arc', 'Lamp'
#      Obj: Object observing job
#      Flip: Meridian flip routine to ensure that the telescope is rotated when the object crosses the meridian. 
#
#RA and Dec can either be given in the format hh:mm:ss/dd:mm:ss or decimal hours and decimal degrees
#
#Modes can be: 
#      RheaGuiding: Mode where just the guiding loop is activated upon finding a star (no spectrograph connected)
#      RheaFull: Full working Rhea spectrograph mode
#      Phot: Mode where a CCD camera is connected directly on the telescope
#
#Filter options not integrated yet.
