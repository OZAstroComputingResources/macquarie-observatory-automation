This file contains a detailed description of all the steps required to install the software. More importantly, it should contain the most up-to-date instructions on what software is required to run all aspects of the obs.


- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04

- Start by installing a few things that won't hurt and will be useful in the future, along with things that are needed.

sudo apt-get install emacs vim screen uvcdynctrl
sudo adduser `whoami` dialout
sudo apt-get remove modemmanager

This last step will help you connect to the serial port without requiring sudo permissions

Now restart the system.

Ok, lets get going....

- Firstly, clone the repository: 

sudo apt-get install git gitk
git clone https://jpsbento@code.google.com/p/macquarie-observatory-automation/ 

- Then, each of these sections refers to installing stuff necessary for aspects of running the obs

- General requirements:

IRAF/PyRAF is a requirement. At this time, the installation of UREKA contains also ipython and all the standard science/plotting/fits modules, so in one go, this can be done. The download is large (1GB) but will work. 

- Go to ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/ Click on the latest version and download and run the installer in your home directory.
Change the .bashrc file to include the 'ur_setup' command at the end of the file. Restart terminal. NOw IRAF/PyRAF and all of python is installed. However, this will cause problems with pkg-config (do ur_forget if you need pkg-config). Soon the dependency on iraf should be eliminated.

- For serial communication with python: 

pip install pyserial
